# Random-Number-Generator
It is not possible to generate random numbers with a specific standard deviation. The standard deviation of the generated numbers will depend on the distribution of the numbers and the random seed used to generate the numbers. However, you can modify the code to generate random numbers that have a target average and try to get close to the target standard deviation.
